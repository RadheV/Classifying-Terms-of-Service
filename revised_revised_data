you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information   Trello Partners  We work with third

your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations  We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing, like when you agree to us sharing your information with a Trello Expert for support related questions   Third Party apps  You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by enabling third party apps like Power Ups within the Services  Doing so may give third party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps  If you are an administrator or contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third party app provider upon installation  Third party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third party apps use your information  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services

our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Trello, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or
